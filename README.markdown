HTML5-Gewgaws
=============

This is a collection of gewgaws written for HTML5, generally (if not
exclusively) in Javascript.

"Gewgaw" means exactly what it sounds like.  But if you insist on a more
specific description, think: small entertainments that are somewhere
between automata, games, and art.

(A corollary of this is that if something is a proper HTML5 game or automaton
or whatever, it will probably have its own repo instead of being in this one.)

If you want to see these gewgaws in action, you should head on over to
[the online Gallery at Cat's Eye Technologies](http://catseye.tc/node/Online_Installation).

Many of these gewgaws make use of the [yoob.js](http://catseye.tc/node/yoob.js)
library.  In these cases, the gewgaw will have its own `yoob` subdirectory with
a snapshot of (the parts of) `yoob.js` that it uses, from the version of
`yoob.js` that was current when it was written.  Consolidation of these into a
common `yoob-0.x` directory of some sort is a future possibility.

The contents of this repo are in the public domain; see the file `UNLICENSE`
for more information.  This includes any images found within, which I have
either obtained from public domain sources, or hereby place into the public
domain.  This includes, too, the bits and pieces of `yoob.js`, which is
itself in the public domain.
